# What is an ISO file?: Only read sections 1.1 - 1.4 inclusively.

### 1. What is an ISO File?
An ISO file, often called an ISO image, is a single file that's a perfect representation of an entire CD, DVD, or BD. The entire contents of a disc can be precisely duplicated in a single ISO file.
### 2. How do you write an ISO file to a CD, DVD, or removable media (like a thumb drive)?
Windows 11, 10, 8, and 7 can all burn ISO images to a disc without using any third-party software—just double-tap or double-click the ISO file and then follow the wizard that appears.
### 3. How do you create an ISO file?
1. On the Windows 10 download page, download the media creation tool by selecting Download tool now, then run the tool.

2. In the tool, select Create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO) for another PC > Next.

3. Select the language, architecture, and edition of Windows, you need and select Next.

4. Select ISO file > Next, and the tool will create your ISO file for you.

5. To use the ISO file as a backup for your PC or on another PC, burn it onto a DVD.
### 4. How do you mount an ISO file?
Double-click to mount ISO files directly into your system via a virtual drive. Alternatively, right-click the ISO file and click “Mount” to run the ISO mount.
